## What is Fake News?
  A type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often  achieved with political agendas. Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.

## Detecting Fake News with Python
To build a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE.

## About Detecting Fake News with Python
This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.

## Project Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need to install the following libraries with pip:<br>
--pip install numpy pandas sklearn
